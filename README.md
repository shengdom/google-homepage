This is my first own project to make a Homepage with HTML and CSS.

The curriculum is taken from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The Task:

- Build the Google.com Homepage
-> A simplified version with only the search box, which does not have to do anything yet)
